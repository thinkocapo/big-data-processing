bin/kafaka-server-start.sh config/server.properties 7:04p
^^is one-node cluster
log activity in oboth panes

.yaml
ports: - "2181:2181" don't realy need because we're executing things inside of the container on kafka, don't need to expose it
'environment variables that container exposes'
`HOSTNAME_COMMAND
PORTS: - 9092 "makes it run on 9092, but does not expose it" "don't try expose it 9092:9092 because all nodes will be listening on 9092"

'one more containre to run the python example...'
python-example: depends_on: -fafka -zookeeper
'volumes: - "./python:/python" makes my machine's code available to the d containers....'

7 start docker...
# single-node kafka cluster
docker-compose -f kafka-docker-compose.yaml up -d
docker ps -a
(see 1 zookeepr, 1 kafka node, 1 python container)
'3 node cluster using teh scale option in docker-compose'
docker-compose -f kafka-docker-compose.yaml up -d --scale kafka=3
*WOOOAHH* so `--scale kafka=3` makes 3 of them
docker ps -a
(see 3 kafkas running)

8 18:29 connect to a running Kafka container
docker exec -it <NAME of container> bash
"it didnt matter which node we exec'd (connected) to"
