The reason streaming processing is so fast is because it analyzes the data before it hits the disk

at-rest vs in-flight data


time-window vs rolling sum

sensor

tumbling windows - like window but aggregate a count within each window
'trigger policy' "no more than 5 cars [within window]"

discretize stream into non-overlapping windows
'eviction'

?
sliding windows - policies are all based on time. eviction defined by the window length.
trigger defined by the sliding window
"tumbling window with sliding..."

'watermark'
incremental algorithms instead of batch algorithms


Hyperloglog for cardinality, probabilistic
(HLL)
